# üèÅ F1 Grand Prix Winner Prediction

This project predicts the **possible winner** of a Formula 1 Grand Prix using data from the four sessions that take place before the race:

* **FP1 (Free Practice 1)**
* **FP2 (Free Practice 2)**
* **FP3 (Free Practice 3)**
* **Qualifying**

The model analyzes performances from these sessions to forecast the most likely race winner.
